TicTacToe v2
- separated game, board, and square classes
- has callbacks registered from board to game
- dynamic grid size
- - game state is updated
- - board is redrawn
- - - line matching array is updated
- - - calculation of winner is done via loops
- - - reduced calling of winner calculation to one
- - highlighting works

How my mind works!!!

- following lessons learned
- - JavaScript
- - - learned == vs ===; specially comparing numerics :)
- - - keep functions small and cohesive to their task
- - ReactJS
- - - render does not like loops
- - - use array.map vs for..loop
